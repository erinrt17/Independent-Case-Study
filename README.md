# Where in Chicago Should I Live? An Independent Case Study üè°

This is an independent final project I've performed for BDI 475 - Introduction to Data Analytics Applications in Business.

For my independent case study, I chose to analyze different neighborhoods in Chicago to make an data-driven, informed decision for when I start looking for apartments. Growing up in the Chicago suburbs, I have a general idea of different neighborhoods but not enough to make a decision on where I want to sign a lease next year. The purpose of this case study is to help me better understand Chicago's neighborhoods so I can make an informed decision on where to live.
